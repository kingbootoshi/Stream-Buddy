 =## Voice Agent ↔ Overlay Integration

This document explains how the Python backend (Pipecat voice agent) and the PixiJS overlay communicate, and how to operate the system via hotkeys.

### Overview

The audio path stays local using Pipecat's `LocalAudioTransport`. A lightweight control plane exposes a WebSocket and small HTTP API so the backend can drive the overlay's
animations in real time.

High level:
- Backend runs Pipecat pipeline for STT → LLM → TTS
- Backend hosts FastAPI control server on `127.0.0.1:8710`
- Overlay connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:8710/ws/overlay`
- Backend broadcasts events like `listen_on`, `start_talking {mood}`
- Overlay maps events to `DuckBuddy` states (`handsCrossed`, `talk`, `happyTalk`, `angryTalk`)

### Why it’s robust
- Mic frames are dropped unless explicitly listening (push-to-talk)
- STT is auto-muted during TTS (no echo/feedback)
- WebSocket reconnect with snapshot so the overlay recovers state immediately

### Control server

File: `backend/overlay_server.py`

- WebSocket: `/ws/overlay` (server → overlay)
- HTTP (all require header `X-Overlay-Key`):
  - `POST /api/listen/start` – unmute mic (enter listening)
  - `POST /api/listen/stop` – mute mic (exit listening)
  - `POST /api/listen/toggle` – toggle mic listening ON/OFF
  - `POST /api/talk/mood` – set default talking mood: `{"mood":"neutral|happy|angry"}`
  - `POST /api/hat` – set hat: `{"hat":"hat1|hat2|hat3"}` or `null`
  - `POST /api/force-state` – force a visual state or clear with `null`
  - `GET /healthz` – liveness + snapshot

Events (server → overlay):
- `hello { snapshot }`
- `listen_on` / `listen_off`
- `start_talking { mood }` / `stop_talking`
- `set_hat { hat }`
- `force_state { state|null }`

### Backend pipeline

Files: `backend/main.py`, `backend/src/processors/mic_gate.py`

- Custom MicGate (FrameProcessor) hard-gates mic input/VAD frames pre‑STT while muted
- STTMuteFilter(ALWAYS) mutes STT whenever TTS is speaking (anti‑barge‑in)
- TTS start/stop drives overlay events so animations sync precisely with audio

### Overlay behavior

File: `src/overlay-controller.ts`

- Connects to WS and applies events to `DuckBuddy`
- Schedules idle/walk when not talking
- While `listen_on`, holds `handsCrossed` (awaiting input)

### Hotkeys

We recommend Hammerspoon on macOS for system-wide hotkeys.

Example toggle (Cmd+Alt+Space):
```lua
local overlayKey = "devlocal"
local base = "http://127.0.0.1:8710"
local function post(path) hs.http.asyncPost(base..path, "", { ["X-Overlay-Key"]=overlayKey }, function() end) end
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd","alt"}, "space", function() post("/api/listen/toggle") end)
```

### Runbook

1. Backend
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env   # fill in keys + OVERLAY_KEY
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 main.py
   ```
2. Frontend
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. OBS Browser Source → point to dev server URL (transparent background)

### Troubleshooting
- Overlay not moving? Check WS logs in devtools and backend `/healthz`.
- Bot hears you while speaking? Confirm STTMuteFilter is active and always strategy is used.
- Hotkey no-op? Verify `OVERLAY_KEY` and Hammerspoon Accessibility permission.

### Voice Agent Integration Plan

Goal: When the backend streams audio (or signals speech activity), the overlay should play a selected talking animation (`neutral` | `happy` | `angry`). While not talking, Quest Boo should alternate between idle and autonomous walking. When the stream ends, he returns to the idle/walk cycle.

This document proposes a front-end control API and message schema to drive the overlay from any backend (WebSocket, SSE, or postMessage). Implementers can adapt transport as needed.

#### Front-end control API (to be added)
We will expose a small controller module, conceptually as follows:

```ts
// Pseudo-API shape (to be implemented)
type TalkMood = 'neutral' | 'happy' | 'angry'

interface OverlayController {
  // Start talking animation in the specified mood; remains active until stopTalking.
  startTalking(mood: TalkMood): void

  // Stop talking and resume normal idle/walk cycles.
  stopTalking(): void

  // Optional: force walking/idle for testing
  forceWalk(): void
  forceIdle(): void
  clearForces(): void
}

// The instance would be attached to window for easy integration:
// (window as any).overlay = controller
```

Under the hood:
- `startTalking()` maps mood to `DuckBuddy.setState('talk'|'happyTalk'|'angryTalk')`.
- Movement controller in `main.ts` continues to run but will only translate X while the rig is in `walk` state. When `startTalking()` is active, we set a timer to pause horizontal movement (character stays put) and keep only mouth/eyes animating.
- `stopTalking()` resumes the background cycle: random walk interleaved with idle.

#### Event/message schema
Transport-agnostic JSON messages suggested for a WS/SSE channel named `overlay-control`:

```json
{ "type": "start_talking", "mood": "neutral" }
{ "type": "start_talking", "mood": "happy" }
{ "type": "start_talking", "mood": "angry" }
{ "type": "stop_talking" }
```

Notes:
- Backends that already stream audio can send `start_talking` when speech energy crosses a VAD threshold, and `stop_talking` after trailing silence (e.g., >300ms) or after the stream completes.
- If real audio waveforms are available in the browser, the mouth animation speed can be modulated by RMS/energy for extra liveliness (optional future work).

#### Idle/Walk scheduler
The current code moves horizontally whenever state is `walk`. To have Quest Boo “sometimes idle, sometimes roam”, add a simple scheduler (to be implemented):

```ts
// Conceptual only — integrate into main.ts
let cycleTimerMs = 0
let nextCycleMs = 2500 + Math.random() * 4000
let isRoaming = true

function updateCycle(dtMs: number) {
  if (overlayIsTalking) return // talking overrides cycles
  cycleTimerMs += dtMs
  if (cycleTimerMs >= nextCycleMs) {
    isRoaming = !isRoaming
    buddy.setState(isRoaming ? 'walk' : 'idle')
    cycleTimerMs = 0
    nextCycleMs = 2500 + Math.random() * 4000
  }
}
```

Integrate by calling `updateCycle(dtMs)` in the ticker before motion. Movement logic remains unchanged: it only translates X when the state is `walk`.

#### Minimal backend sequence example
1. Page connects a WebSocket to your backend and subscribes to `overlay-control`.
2. Backend starts streaming TTS/voice; on first audio chunk emit `{ type: 'start_talking', mood: 'happy' }`.
3. Page calls `overlay.startTalking('happy')` which sets `happyTalk` state and pauses horizontal translation.
4. When audio stream completes (or VAD detects silence), backend emits `{ type: 'stop_talking' }`.
5. Page calls `overlay.stopTalking()` which resumes the idle/walk scheduler.

#### Security and resilience
- Validate incoming message types and fields before acting.
- Ignore duplicate `start_talking` if already talking with same mood.
- Time out talking after N seconds as a guardrail in case the backend disconnects.

#### TODOs for implementation (tracked here for future PR)
- Implement `OverlayController` in `main.ts` and attach to `window`.
- Add the idle/walk scheduler stub above.
- Optionally expose `setSpeed`, `setBounds`, and `setFacing` overrides for experimentation.

### Why a custom MicGate FrameProcessor

Pipecat’s stock filters (FunctionFilter/FrameFilter/NullFilter) always pass System frames. `InputAudioRawFrame` (mic audio) and VAD/Interruption frames are System frames, so built‑in filters cannot truly block them pre‑STT. To implement a true push‑to‑talk toggle (mic fully off until enabled), we use a tiny custom FrameProcessor:

- Placed before STT to prevent audio from ever reaching the STT service
- Drops only `InputAudioRawFrame` and VAD/Interruption frames when `listening` is off or TTS is speaking
- Always forwards lifecycle frames (e.g., `StartFrame`) and all non‑input frames
- Composes with `STTMuteFilter(ALWAYS)` after STT for clean anti‑barge‑in during bot speech

Operationally:
- Start muted (`listening=false`): no audio or VAD leaves the input transport
- Toggle on: MicGate allows input/VAD; STT resumes and downstream proceeds
- During bot speech: STTMuteFilter mutes STT regardless of toggle to avoid echo/overlap

This achieves a hard mic cutoff at the correct boundary with predictable behavior and low code surface.
