1. give quest boo access to see usernames of twitch chat and me (DONE)
2. give quest boo a consistent short term memory via local database like sqlite, make sure on restart it reads and applies to this database
3. give quest boo a present and long term memory by consoslidating the short term chat history
4. give quest boo access to see my screen via screenshots
-> i think there should be another ai that runs in parallel that sees the screen and describes it, and injects that into quest boo's pipeline anytime he speaks
